## What you should provide us
We expect you to create a Kaggle notebook (https://www.kaggle.com/docs/kernels) 
with your solution, explaining how you approached the problem presented in the 
challenge. It is important to describe which decisions you have made and the 
rationale behind each. Also, you should explain how you cleaned and processed 
the data, which algorithms you have used, the strategy you applied on feature 
engineering and everything else you assume is important for us to understand 
your solution.
